# Frequently Asked Questions

**Which SDK is right for me?**

It all depends on what you want to do.  If you are looking to automate repetitive tasks in Rhino, writing a [Python]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/#rhinopython) script is the way to go.  If you are looking to write a full-fledged plugin or Grasshopper component, we strongly suggest the [RhinoCommon SDK]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/rhinocommon/what_is_rhinocommon/).  If you are very proficient with C/C++, you should consider the native C/C++ SDK (only supported on Rhino for Windows).

**Can I write plugins that run on both Windows and Mac?**

Yes...even using [the same code]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/rhinocommon/what_is_rhinocommon/).

**What is Mono/Xamarin?**

Mono is an open-source version of Microsoft's .NET runtime that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android.  Check out the [What are Mono and Xamarin?]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/rhinocommon/what_are_mono_and_xamarin/) guide for more information.
