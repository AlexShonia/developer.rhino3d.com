title: Write and Edit content

We need to come up with templates / conventions for content but for now add your markdown files in the following directories:  

  - guides under \_guide_topics  
  - samples under \_samples
  - blog posts under \_posts  
    see [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for post name conventions.
