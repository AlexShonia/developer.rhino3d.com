# Welcome.  

This site is the future home of developer.rhino3d.com.  This is very much a Work In Progress.  Our website is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com). If you find errors or think a page could be improved, just click the “Edit page on GitHub” link beneath the page title (COMING SOON). See contributing to the website for more details.

#### Etc (to be removed soon)

The [Kramdown] markdown parser, the default parser with Jekyll, has support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).  

ex:  
$$y = {\sqrt{x^2+(x-1)} \over x-3} + \left| 2x \over x^{0.5x} \right|$$  

See the [guides]({{ '/guides' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to read about how to [run jekyll locally]({{ '/guides/setup_jekyll' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or [write content]({{ '/guides/write_content' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
