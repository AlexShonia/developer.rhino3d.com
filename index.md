# Welcome

**Rhino developer tools are royalty free and include support.**

This site is the _future home_ of developer.rhino3d.com.  The goal of this site is to consolidate all the (now) scattered developer documentation into a single canonical site that is clear, easy-to-navigate, with consistent formatting and nomenclature.  _This site is a work-in-progress_.  

The sources of content-to-be-consolidated are:

- [Rhino Developer Tools wiki](http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/home)
- [RhinoCommon API references](http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocommon/)
- [C++ SDK API references](http://4.rhino3d.com/5/rhinocppsdk/idx.html)
- [RhinoCommon samples on GitHub](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon/tree/master/examples)
- [DaleF's CsCommands](https://github.com/dalefugier/SampleCsCommands/)
- [Doxygen Docs (on McNeel intranet)](http://phab.mcneel.com/docs/rhino/6/rhinocommon/)

This website is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com). If you find errors or think a page could be improved, just click the “Edit page on GitHub” link at the bottom of the page.  See [contributing to this website](#this-website) below for more details.

#### GitHub

Many [McNeel projects](http://github.com/mcneel) are open-source and on [GitHub](http://github.com/).  [RhinoCommon](https://github.com/mcneel/rhinocommon) - our cross-platform .NET API - is a great example. Even [this very website](https://github.com/mcneel/developer-rhino3d-com) you are reading now. Browse source, fork a repo, correct a typo: we welcome participation and pull-requests.


#### Discourse

[discourse.mcneel.com](http://discourse.mcneel.com) is the McNeel forum.  This is the fastest place to get help.  Specific categories to  in are:
