Websites are becoming leaner, faster and more agile, as users demand quick, seamless experiences. The solution is to utilize a lightweight, static website generator, which can make building and maintaining websites incredibly simple, as there is no database to slow requests down, and web servers automatically cache headers, reducing bandwidth usage.

Static sites also offer greater security, as they do not contain dynamic content, so are immune to the most common attacks. Storing content in flat, text files, makes them ideal to be used with version control systems, such as Git. Utilizing a static site generator means you can build websites with modern frameworks, and workflows, with a high degree of productivity and efficiency.

We have compiled 13 of the best static site generators, which are easy to scale, offer secure filesystems, increased performance and are quick to setup.
